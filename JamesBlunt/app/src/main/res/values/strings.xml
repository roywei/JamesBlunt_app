        \nBio: ‘I have never been a beautiful boy.
        \n \u0020 \u0020 \u0020 \u0020 Never liked the sound of my own voice.
        \n \u0020 \u0020 \u0020 \u0020 I wasn’t cool when I was in my teens,
        \n \u0020 \u0020 \u0020 \u0020 I never slept, but I did have dreams.’ – Bones
        \nMoon Landing is the fourth album by James Blunt.
        It’s an album about dreams, longing, first love.
        About looking in the mirror and seeing the boy you were,
        the man you are – and learning to be comfortable with that, flaws and all.
        About getting back to basics and rediscovering the power of music to communicate
        emotion directly and honestly, without too much polish or complication.
